# ReactJS Developer Coding Assignment

This is a React app that I created using Create React App.

## How to run the app locally

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Source Code**: Download the source code provided in the attachment.

2. **Extract the Files**: Extract the downloaded zip file to a location on your computer.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted project directory.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```

5. **Start the Development Server**:  Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:
```bash
   npm run start
```
6. **View the Application**:  Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.


# Important Note
This project relies on the following libraries for additional functionality:

1. react-icons for displaying icons.
2. Tailwind CSS for styling.
3. react-hot-toast for displaying toast notifications.

If you encounter any issues related to missing icons, styling, or toast notifications while running the application, make sure to install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash 
npm install react-icons tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss autoprefixer react-hot-toast
```
