# ReactJS Developer Coding Assignment

This is a React app that I created using Create React App.

## How to run the app locally

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the GitHub repository to your computer using the following command:
```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/popli610/DigitalJalebiAssignment.git]
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned project directory.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```
5. **Environment Variables**: This project utilizes environment variables to manage configuration settings. If you need to customize any environment-specific values, create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and define your variables there. You can refer to the .env.example file for a template.
   Here's an example of how to define environment variables in the .env file:
   ```bash
      REACT_APP_BASE_URL=https://dummyjson.com
   ```


6. **Start the Development Server**:  Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running:
```bash
   npm run start
```
7. **View the Application**:  Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
